description: Girls, I've got the grandest surprise for you!" Betty Nelson crossed
  the velvety green lawn, and crowded into the hammock, slung between two apple trees,
  which were laden with green fruit. First she had motioned for Grace Ford to make
  room for her, and then sank beside her chum with a sigh of relief. "Oh, it was so
  warm walking over!" she breathed. "And I did come too fast, I guess." She fanned
  herself with a filmy handkerchief.
